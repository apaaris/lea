## What is lea?
Lea is a lightweight active control system for supersonic rockets. It was first implemented for a rocket science school project, controlling a 100 kg rocket that flies at 22k ft.

### Goals
- Lightweight design <= 1 kg 
- Withstand the forces of a 1.2 Mach flight
- Actively improve the flight stability 

### To Do
- Add BOM
- Add gears and shorten axle
- Implement an open source control algorithm

#### Btw, who's lea?
I actually don't know.
