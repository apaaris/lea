## What is lea?
Lea is a lightweight active control system for supersonic rockets. It was first implemented for a rocket science school project, controlling a 100 kg rocket that flies at 22k ft.

### Goals
- Lightweight design <= 1 kg   <div align="right">![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Weight-0.75%20kg-success)</div>
- Withstand the forces of a 1.2 Mach flight <div align="right">![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/FEA-check-success)</div>
- Actively improve the flight stability <div align="right">![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Testing-TBD-yellow)</div>
